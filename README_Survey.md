**Purpose of the Study**  
The purpose of this survey is to better understand attitudes/opinions and levels of engagement of those who work on marine mammal issues regarding how scientific results are applied to marine mammal conservation, policy, and management. A similar survey was originally designed and conducted in 2007 by Vicki Cornish and Raychelle Daniel, while working for the Ocean Conservancy. The principal investigator is re-administering the survey to assess current attitudes and how they might have changed since 2007. Only minor modifications to the questions have been made to modernize the survey.

**Study Procedures and Outcomes**  
The survey consists of multiple choice, check-box, rating, and open-ended questions related to marine mammal conservation. It is being administered through SurveyMonkey for a period of six weeks (until 20 September 2019). The results of this survey will be shared as a poster presentation at the World Marine Mammal Conference in Barcelona, Spain, in December 2019 (Abstract 1121). The results will also be distributed to the MARMAM list-serve and shared broadly with
interested government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and others interested in improving communication efforts related to the conservation of marine mammals.

**Risks and Discomforts**  
Sharing attitudes and personal levels of engagement on conservation, policy, and management issues by marine mammal scientists, researchers, managers, and advocates can be a sensitive subject, even when done anonymously. The principal investigator appreciates that it may be difficult or uncomfortable to express honest opinions on these issues and is grateful for all those who take the time to complete the survey.

**Privacy/Confidentiality**  
All survey responses will be anonymous. Some demographic information will be collected, but it will not be used for identification. Additionally, the data will be reported statistically, not on an individual basis, with the exception of open-ended comments. If shared, those comments will not be linked to any personal identifying information.

**Taking part is voluntary**  
Your involvement in this survey is voluntary, and you may choose not to participate or to stop at any time without penalty or any other consequences.
